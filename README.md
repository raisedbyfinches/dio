# Dio

A rather tenuous name. The aim is to "brand" functions with a "created by AI" message and attributes to help identify them.

Brand -> Brando -> Dio Brando -> Dio -> [Za Warudo](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/The_World)

This is a repository of useful functions and tools for working with code generated by AI tools. 


## Installation

Each language's tools will live on their own branches. To install them use the instructions below.

### Python

I recommend managing `dio` as a dependency using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). You can add it to your project dependencies using

``` toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
dio = { git = "https://github.com/raisedbyfinches/dio.git", branch = "python" }
```

If this is not available, wheels and tar.gz archives will be distributed under releases.
